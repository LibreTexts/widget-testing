# @jupyterlab/translation

Translation utilities.

Installed with Tarball from [here](https://developer.aliyun.com/mirror/npm/package/@jupyterlab/translation). Provides some of the functions used in `widgets.ts` of jupyterlab for the Javascript errors in `bokeh`. Needed for `ITranslator` which is referenced in jupyterlab [here](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/master/packages/translation/src/tokens.ts#L75) and [here](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/master/packages/rendermime/src/widgets.ts#L421).
